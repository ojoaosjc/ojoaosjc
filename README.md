# Hey there! 👋

I'm Joao Victor, a Systems Information student from Brazil.

I'm focused on building a solid foundation in Linux, Networking, Docker and AWS through practical, real-world projects.  
Everything I learn, I turn into experiments, labs and small automations — and add here as part of my portfolio.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** – users, permissions, services, networking  
- **Shell Script** – automations and system tasks  
- **Docker** – containers, images and basic deployments  
- **Networking** – DNS, DHCP, ports, routing, troubleshooting  
- **AWS** – EC2, S3, IAM (Free Tier labs)  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and documentation  

## 📌 Currently Working On
- Projects for Infra/DevOps using Linux, Docker and AWS  
- Building a complete portfolio for internships in Support, Infra or Cloud  
- Creating small labs and scripts to practice real-world scenarios
